# Tyler Walter's Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio not intended for any other use than to display my projects.

## Description
This portfolio displays some of my projects that I have done in the past with regards to software development. I will be adding onto this README as time progresses, but for now, it's just a basic portfolio with [links](https://github.com/TyWalter) to my projects.
